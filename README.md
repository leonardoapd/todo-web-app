Project Description:

A robust web application project showcasing my proficiency in React and Vite, focused on a To-Do application. The project incorporates essential features such as login and signup forms, authentication interceptors, and custom hooks. By leveraging React's capabilities and Vite's efficiency, the application delivers a seamless user experience while demonstrating my skills in modern web development.

Demo: You can see the live demo of the Todo List by visiting this link: [Todo List Demo](https://todo-webapp-2023.netlify.app/)

Experience: During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) using React. Through implementing HTTP requests with axios to the backend, I enhanced my understanding of frontend-backend communication and real-time data manipulation. 

Additionally, I acquired skills in implementing custom hooks to reuse logic and facilitate component development, resulting in improved development efficiency. 

Moreover, I utilized a router to manage application navigation and ensure a seamless user experience. 

Furthermore, I implemented interceptors to enhance security and protect sensitive data, thereby improving the overall integrity of the application. 

These accomplishments significantly contributed to my growth as a developer and strengthened my skill set in full-stack web development.
